In this motor, you see a motor with more power, but it is consuming less current, which means we will see more torque with uses of less current. It is a new design for the syn motors. Here is how Iâ€™ll explain in this project to you, now the tesla motor we use is a synrm motor. In the quarter area of the motor tesla use two magnets (neodymium magnet),
